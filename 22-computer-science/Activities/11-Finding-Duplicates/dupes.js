// the above algorithm isn't very efficient, because we have a nested for loop, which is never ideal. how could we solve this same problem without putting a for loop inside another for loop? if done correctly, we should be able to significantly reduce the time complexity.

// hint: there's nothing wrong with having two loops, as long as one isn't inside the other

// second hint: maybe an object could help us track the values and their totals

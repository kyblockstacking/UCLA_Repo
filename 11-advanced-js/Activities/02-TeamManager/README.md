# **Instructions**

* Run the Team Manager game by typing `node teamManager.js`

* This app is _almost_ working, but there are several bugs that are holding it back. Can you fix them? Run the app and note the error messages. Try to figure out what they mean. Even when the app is running with no errors being logged, there could still be "logic" errors that prevent the app from behaving as expected. Don't assume you've completely fixed it until you've tested every option in the game.

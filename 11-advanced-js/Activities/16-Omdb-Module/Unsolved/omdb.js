// npm module to make http requests
var request = require("request");

// TO DO: write a constructor function for omdb that takes in one argument, the api key, and saves it as a property. then create two methods, search and get, that will call the corresponding api endpoints.

// "search" should do a generic search and return an array of movies while "get" should find a specific movie and return an object. both methods will need to accept two arguments: the title to search for and a callback function.

// REMINDER: export your constructor so main.js can import/require it

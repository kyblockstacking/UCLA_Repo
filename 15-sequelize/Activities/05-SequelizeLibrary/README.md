* Folder: `05-SequelizeLibrary/Unsolved`

* INSTRUCTIONS:

  * Create a `'sequelize_library'` DB.
  * Modify `'connection.js'` to include your MySQL user/database information.
  * In the `'models'` folder, modify the `book.js` file to create a book model. Further details can be found inside this file.
    * Your book model must include a title, author, genre, page numbers.
  * Modify `'api-routes.js'` using sequelize query methods to create the required routes.

  * **BONUS:** Searches have to be an exact match. How can we account for partial matches?

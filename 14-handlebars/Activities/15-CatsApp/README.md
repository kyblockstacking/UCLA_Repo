# Instructions

  * Given the following app, which currently works, add the ability to "delete" cats. This will include adding a delete button on the front-end, jQuery code to capture the button click, and corresponding back-end logic to actually receive the request and remove the cat from the database.

  * This is going to be a difficult task, because we didn't build this app and don't immediately know where everything is. The app was designed with MVC architecture in mind, though, and, as new developers to the project, we should do our best to mirror the workflow that's already been established for existing tasks.

  * With a partner, follow the steps of how a new cat is added to the database. Note which files you end up stepping through, including the model and ORM. We want our delete functionality to follow a similar path.

  * It may be helpful to first take stock of which files are front-end and which files are back-end, as there are _a lot_ of files in this project overall.

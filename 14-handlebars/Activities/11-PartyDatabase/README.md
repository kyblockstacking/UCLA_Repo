 # PartyDatabase 

* You will be creating a holiday party planner application. We want to help create parties for our clients whilst also keeping track of all the events that we are hosting. In MySQL, create a database called `party_db` with two tables structured like the tables below. Utilize the provided `schema.sql` and `seeds.sql` file in order to build the tables and seed initial values.

    | id | party_name              | party_type | party_cost | client_id |
    | -- | ----------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------- |
    | 1  | Everybody Loves Raymond | tv         | 500        | 1         |
    | 2  | Big Bang Theory         | tv         | 900        | 1         |
    | 3  | Top Gun                 | movie      | 200        | 2         |
    | 4  | Whiskey                 | grown-up   | 300        | 2         |
    | 5  | Cigar                   | grown-up   | 250        | 3         |

    | id | client_name |
    | -- | ----------- |
    | 1  | Bilal       |
    | 2  | Brianne     |
    | 3  | Vincent     |

## Instructions

* Create a Node MySQL application with an ORM that executes various methods once the server is launched.

* You will not need Express or Handlebars for this assignment. Use `console.log` to print the data collected to the console.

* Create a MySQL database with the tables and data from the provided sql files.

* Create a Node app and connect it to MySQL with a `config` folder and with a `connection.js` file inside of that folder.

* Copy over the `orm.js` file from the previous activity and use the ORM to:

  * Console log all of the parties that have a party-type of "grown-up."
  * Console log all of the clients and their parties together.

* Once that is working, add a new method to the ORM that can do a generic "group by" query against the database to show how many times a column value is repeated. The groupBy method should accept two arguments: the table name and the column that you want to group by.

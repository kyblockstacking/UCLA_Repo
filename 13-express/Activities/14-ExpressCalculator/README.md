# Express Calculator

## Instructions

* You will create an Express calculator application with one get route that is able to take in three parameters: an operation and two numbers.

* There are four operation values which a user may use: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

* When the route is hit, your browser should display the result of the math operation.

* For example, when the user goes to the url <http://localhost:3000/add/10/1>, the page should display 11.

* **BONUS:** Allow special characters like `+` and `*` as well as the English words.

* **BONUS:** Look into how you could account for _any_ number of digits. For example, the same route could handle five numbers after the operator or fifty.

# Express POST Routes

Download a program called `Postman` and use it to make a POST request to <http://localhost:3000>. If done correctly, you should see the phrase "Knock, knock" printed in your terminal and "Who's there" printed in Postman.

Try making a new POST route now (e.g. `/test`) with Express that console.logs a different message and sends a different response. Test your POST route with Postman.

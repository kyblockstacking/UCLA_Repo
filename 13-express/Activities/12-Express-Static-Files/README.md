# Express Static Files

* Run the server and visit <http://localhost:3000>. With a partner, explain why only one image is showing up.

* Now fix the other three images.

* If your instinct was to create three more GET routes, that certainly works, but this doesn't feel like a very good approach. What if we had hundreds of images? See if you can find a better way. (Hint: look up "express static files")

* **BONUS:** Make an "assets" folder and move the "images" folder inside of it. Also make a `styles.css` file in the assets folder. What do you have to change to get all of these static files set up for your client to see?

# GifTastic Bonuses

Over the long weekend, hone your API and jQuery skills by implementing serveral extra features in your app. Some suggestions:

* Sort the GIFs by their rating.

* Animate the GIFs on a mouse over effect, not on click.

* Put the GIFs into Bootstrap rows and columns with a maximum of 3-4 GIFs per row.

* Add a second API. For example, your GIFs could be movie-related, so when you click a button, you can display movie info and GIFs at the same time.

* When you click on a GIF, show the animated/larger version of the GIF in a modal/overlay.

* Look up `localStorage` and how you could use it to "save" the buttons that users add to your website. Meaning if they refresh the page, the user-generated buttons are still there.

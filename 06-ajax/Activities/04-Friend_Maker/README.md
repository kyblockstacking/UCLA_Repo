# Friend Maker 3000

## File

* [`friends.html`](Unsolved/friends.html)

## Instructions

* We're going to use the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/documentation) to request 3 fake friends and display them to the user. Each time we request these friends, we should make a Bootstrap row with 3 columns and add it to the existing `<div class="container">` element.

* Each column should show the friend's name and profile picture. Look at the JSON data to know how to access this information.

* Once the first 3 friends are displaying correctly, update the code to make this same request again 3 seconds later. When finished, our app should show 3 more friends every 3 seconds.

### Bonus

* Track how many friends we've made and display the total to the user somewhere on the page.

* Add a stop button to stop making friends.

* Update the app to make 6 friends at a time instead of 3.

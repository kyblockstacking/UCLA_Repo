# Button Triggered AJAX

## File

* [`button-triggered-ajax`](Unsolved/button-triggered-ajax.html)

## Instructions

* Add a `data-animal` attribute to each button that will store the name of the animal the button represents.

* Update the button click function to get the animal name from the `data-animal` attribute instead of hard-coding it to "cat."

* Your final application should trigger the correct animal GIF when "cat" or "dog" is clicked.
